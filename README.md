This Symfony2 application provides a dashboard that collects information on
various repositories and allows to search through it. This is particularly
useful if a project spans multiple repositories.

To see a running installation, head to http://cmf.davidbu.ch

Installation
------------

Install and configure [elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/).

This application is a standard Symfony2 project. Best follow the
[Symfony2 guide](http://symfony.com/doc/2.5/book/installation.html).
In very short, this looks like:

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    
    php ./composer.phar create-project dbu/dashboard

During composer install, you will be prompted for your Github credentials,
which will be stored as plain text in `app/config/parameters.yml`. (Even if
your repositories are public, the API only allows 5000 requests per hour
without credentials. A single sync run for large organizations exceeds that
limit.)

*Generate an Github [API Key](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use) for that*

The configuration will also ask for projects, but you might want to leave
that unchanged and then open parameters.yml in an editor.

Install Frontend Dependencies and build the CSS and JS Files (**already done through composer scripts**)

Technology
----------

This application is based on [KNPLabs PHP Github API](https://github.com/KnpLabs/php-github-api)
and [elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org) (with the
[FOSElasticaBundle](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSElasticaBundle)).

For the Frontend Stack we use [ReactJs](http://facebook.github.io/react/) with [cortexjs](http://mquan.github.io/cortex/).
The Build-Tool we use is [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

The Styles are built with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
